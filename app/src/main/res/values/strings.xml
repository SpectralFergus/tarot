    <string name="about">Ask a question, click \"NEW CARDS\", and see what awaits you. Here are the basics:
        \nMajor takes precedence over minor, higher numbers take precedence over lower, and the suits in order of importance
        are Swords(physical), Wands(mental), Cups(social), and Coins/Pentacles(emotional/wealth).
        \n
        \n\nCard data was obtained through "tarot-api" by @ekelen: https://github.com/ekelen/tarot-api.
        \n\nTarot card images are scans of the vintage "Pamela-A" deck provided by Holly Voley at sacred-texts.com, and are within the public domain: http://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/pkt/index.htm

        \n\n\nThank you for using my app! There are tons of amazing tarot card apps out there, but I\'m glad you decided to open mine :).
